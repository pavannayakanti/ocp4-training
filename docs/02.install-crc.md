3. The setup will install **Red Hat OpenShift Local** into  
   `C:\Program Files\Red Hat OpenShift Local`.

---

### 3. Setup OpenShift Local

Open **PowerShell (Run as Administrator)** and run:

```powershell
crc setup
```

This configures the host machine for OpenShift Local.

---

### 4. Start the Cluster

Run:

```powershell
crc start
```

- Paste your **Pull Secret** when prompted.  
- Wait for cluster startup (may take 10â€“15 minutes).

---

### 5. Access the Console

When startup completes, note the console URL and credentials:

```plaintext
https://console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing/
Username: kubeadmin
Password: <shown in PowerShell>
```

Open the URL in your browser.

oc whoami
```

Expected output:

```plaintext
system:admin
```

## Local vs Cloud Cluster â€“ Why Use Each?

### OpenShift Local (CRC)
- Single-node cluster running on your laptop
- Great for learning, demos, and development
- Lightweight, free to use
- Limited resources (depends on your machine)
- No HA (High Availability)

### Cloud Managed OpenShift (ROSA/ARO/OCP Dedicated)
- Multi-node, scalable clusters running on AWS/Azure/Google Cloud
- Fully managed with SLAs, patching, and enterprise support
- Integrated with cloud services (IAM, Key Vault, Load Balancers)
- Production-ready, HA/DR enabled
- Paid (subscription or hourly billing)

ðŸ‘‰ **Rule of thumb:**
- Use **CRC (local)** â†’ for **training, dev, POCs**
- Use **Cloud (ROSA/ARO)** â†’ for **production workloads**

âœ… You now have a working single-node OpenShift 5 cluster on Windows.
